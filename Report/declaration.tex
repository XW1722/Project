For this study, I utilised two primary datasets: one detailing staff numbers sourced from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) official website, and another containing information on UK funding projects within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domain, obtained from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) website. I used the UKRI dataset shared by my colleague, Flavia Trigo, which can be assessed on \href{https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/personal/fcb5018_ic_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=\%2Fpersonal\%2Ffcb5018\%5Fic\%5Fac\%5Fuk\%2FDocuments\%2FFunding\%2DLandscape}{Onedrive}; For the analysis, I downloaded the HESA data from the official website. The (open source) code for the topic modelling was provided by Flavia Trigo, which is public and can be retrieved from \href{https://github.com/FCBT/Funding-Landscape}{Github}. I independently developed the code for the entire analysis, which involved processing the outcomes from the topic analysis, creating visualizations, and conducting hypothesis tests. Under the invaluable guidance of my supervisor, Samraat Pawar, I received precious advice on statistical analyses, direction on the writing process and insights on the types of results to showcase.
