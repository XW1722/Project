For this study, I utilised two primary datasets: one detailing staff numbers sourced from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) official website, and another containing information on UK funding projects within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domain, obtained from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) website. I used the UKRI dataset shared by colleagues which can be assessed on \href{https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/personal/fcb5018_ic_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=\%2Fpersonal\%2Ffcb5018\%5Fic\%5Fac\%5Fuk\%2FDocuments\%2FFunding\%2DLandscape}{Onedrive}; For the analysis, I personally downloaded the HESA data from the official website. Regarding the coding, the machine learning-related code was provided by colleagues, which can be retrieved from the \href{https://github.com/FCBT/Funding-Landscape}{Github}; Meanwhile, I personally generated the coding for the analysis part. Under the invaluable guidance of my supervisor, Samraat Pawar, I received direction on the entire coding and writing process, and insights on the types of results to showcase.
